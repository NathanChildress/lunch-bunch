# Lunch Bunch

## About
Covid-19 has impacted the sense of community within the workplace we once had. Group lunch orders were always something to look forward to. Unfortunately,  due to remote work, sponsored meals are no longer a part of our days.

Lunch Bunch  will provide teams with an exciting solution that will bring back the feeling of sharing a meal together.

Lunch Bunch is an application for organizers to plan synchronized meal deliveries.
